I am unable to execute any shell commands, including `git pull` and `git status`, due to a persistent error related to the `@lydell/node-pty` package. The error message indicates:

"The @lydell/node-pty package supports your platform (win32-x64), but it could not find the binary package for it: @lydell/node-pty-win32-x64/conpty.node

This can happen if you use the "--omit=optional" (or "--no-optional") npm flag.
The "optionalDependencies" package.json feature is used to install the correct
binary executable for your current platform. Remove that flag to use @lydell/node-pty.

This can also happen if the "node_modules" folder was copied between two operating systems
that need different binaries - including "virtual" operating systems like Docker and WSL.
If so, try installing with npm rather than copying "node_modules"."

This issue is preventing me from performing any operations that require shell access. I cannot proceed with pulling the latest version from git or any other tasks until this underlying environment issue is resolved.

Please ensure that the environment where I am running has the correct `@lydell/node-pty` package installed and configured, or address the underlying cause of this error.
